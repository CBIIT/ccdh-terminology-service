# Neo4J Schema

The backend of the database is a Neo4J graph database. The conceptual graph model in the database is based on the 
ISO/IEC 11179-3, a metadata registries metamodel of the International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO)â€™s technical committee on data management and interchange.

The Cypher language is used to define [the schema](../docker/neo4j/cyphers), and the schema is loaded into the docker container automatically when
the container is started.
