## GDC to NCIt mapping

NCIt_Maps_To_GDC.csv is retrieved from [the NCIt mappings page](https://ncithesaurus.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/pages/mapping_search.jsf?nav_type=mappings&b=0&m=0). 

The target_code are mapped to GDC properties in a separate file: NCIt_AB_vs_GDC_Property_10_02_2020.csv

In 10/2020, these files will be replaced with a new version where the target_code will be 
directly coded with GDC proeprties.
